# SiPM-Scanning
Python codes to control stepper motors for a linear stage, picoammeter, and a digital multimeter to scan a SiPM to measure its saturation behavior along with a calibrated PD.

Look in the "Arduino-Stepper-Motors" repository for the arduino firware that I use here to control the stepper motors.
